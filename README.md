Some tools for my 2025 job search.

## Overview

- Top priorities in making these tools:
  - Explore and practice some tech skills.
  - Useful for my own efficiency & insight.
- Not a priority:
  - Generalizing this so that others can use it.
  - Clean architecture and code with an eye toward longer-term maintenance or readability.

I might eventually share these by deploying them publicly with demo data, but for now I'm only running them locally.
